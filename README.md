How are graceful degradation and service workers related?<br>
Graceful degradation is about designing an app to function at an acceptable level, even if some of its features fail. Service workers contribute to graceful degradation by making sure that the app can still function, to some extent, without a network connection. By caching assets and data, service workers allow the application to provide a basic offline experience. <br>
